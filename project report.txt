1. INTRODUCTION
An ATM (Automated Teller Machine) is an electronic device that allows bank customers to perform financial transactions like withdrawal, deposit, balance checking, etc., without visiting the bank.
This project is a simple console-based ATM simulator created using Python. It demonstrates the use of basic programming concepts such as variables, input/output, conditional statements (if-elif-else), and loops (while).

2. OBJECTIVE

To create a menu-driven program in Python
To implement real-life banking operations
To practice the use of loops and decision-making statements
To understand user input handling and basic validation


3. FEATURES (Exactly as in your code)

4-digit default PIN: 1234
Initial balance: ₹5000
Login with single PIN entry (no multiple attempts)
Five main options:
Check Account Balance
Deposit Money
Withdraw Money
Change PIN (4 digits only)
Exit

Simple and clear menu with lines and emojis
Immediate update of balance after deposit/withdrawal


4. SOFTWARE & HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
Software:

Python 3.x
Any Python IDE (IDLE recommended)
Operating System: Windows / Linux / macOS

Hardware:

Any computer with minimum 2 GB RAM

5.LIMITATIONS & FUTURE SCOPE
Limitations of Current Project

Only one attempt allowed for PIN
No validation if PIN contains only digits
No limit on withdrawal/deposit amount
Data is not saved after program closes
No multiple user accounts
